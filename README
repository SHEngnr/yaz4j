COMPILATION

Unix
----

You will need the JDK, Maven, Swig and YAZ development packages.
Consult your package manager on how to install those.

'yaz-config' is assumed to be on the PATH, if it isn't or if local yaz
installation is to be used, its location can be forced with:

mvn -Dyaz.config=/path/to/yaz-config install


Windows
-------

Besides the exact same requirements as in the Unix case, you will need
the Windows SDK installed (which in turn requires .NET Framework 4).

Sensible default is assumed for 'yaz.path' but the 'swig' binary path has
hard-coded version number (see yaz4j/pom.xml) which most likely will need to
be updated to match your Swig version. Both can be overriden through:

mvn -Dyaz.path=/path/to/yaz/installation -Dswig=/path/to/swig/binary install

Use the command prompt provided with the Windows SDK.


RUNNING A TEST PROGRAM

A trivial test program is included in the yaz4.jar, you can invoke it to check
the sanity of your yaz4j compilation/installation. On Windows, the YAZ/bin 
directory (default "C:\Porgam Files\YAZ\bin", if you are using YAZ installer) 
MUST be on the PATH, otherwise dependent shared libraries will fail to load. 
Run:

  java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/yaz4j/dll/or/so/dir -jar any/target/yaz4j.jar

Where "/path/to/yaz4j/dll/or/so/dir" points to the directory containing the
native yaz4j libary (Windows -> yaz4j/win32/target, Unix -> yaz4j/unix/target).
You can omit this flag, if your yaz4j.dll/so is already available on the 
library path.
